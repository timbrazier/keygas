    <div class="grid-item quote">
      <p>
        "I have known Andy for a number of years now as he was the plumber introduced to me by my builders during my house extension. I always find Andy to be a friendly, reliable and trustworthy person, he’s always smiling and turns up when he says he will which is a must in my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andy has carried out many jobs for us over the years including fully fitting our en-suite shower room and servicing and installing the boiler. We have a second house that Andy also maintains the gas appliances for so that they comply with Gas Safe regulations. This is extremely important to us as it is occupied by a tenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would 100% recommend Andy to anyone as all work he has done for us has been of a high standard and at a reasonable price. I even recommended him to my parents and now they won’t call anyone else."

        "We got Andy to install our boiler a few years ago and were very impressed with the professionalism and quality of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have since had Andy service our boiler every year and also service our boilers in our rental properties. We wouldn't trust anyone else! He is always punctual, professional and his work is always to a high standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've since recommended Keygas to our friends."

        "I have used Andy (KeyGas) for the last four years to service my boiler and gas fire as well as to fix some ad-hoc problems with my central heating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all cases Andy completes the work to a high standard and explains any problem clearly. Where non-stocked parts are needed timescales for return and completion are adhered to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always found KeyGas to be easy to deal with, reasonably priced and would recommend to others."

        "A high recommendation for Keygas. They have carried out a range of jobs for us and cannot be faulted on workmanship, price and punctuality. They installed a new central heating system for us while we were away on holiday and you could not tell that they’d been in the house, part from the fact that we now had central heating! Andy is a very pleasant individual whom I would totally endorse (and this is from somebody who used to teach him at school!)"

We would be happy to recommend him to anyone, safe in the knowledge that he is reliable, honest in his appraisals, good value for money and courteous, qualities  which can be sadly lacking with other tradesmen."

        "Andrew has done a number of jobs, both large and small, for us over several years. These have ranged from radiator replacements, central heating repairs to the installation of two complete bathrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work has always been done to a very high standard and finished exactly when Andrew said it would be. When we made major changes to our requirements during the works he still managed to keep to the original timescale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no hesitation is recommending Andrew for any jobs, big or small, and know that he will do the work well and that you will enjoy working with him."

        "I can highly recommend keygas for all plumbing and boiler work. Their work is exemplary. Their boiler service is excellent, not just a quick look like some companies. If they say they are coming at a certain time on a certain day that's when they arrive. Attention to detail is superb."

        "Seven years ago, after a bad experience with another company, Keygas got me out of a terrible mess due to a faulty Gas boiler. Andy has since replaced that boiler with a new one, which he has serviced each year since. Keygas are a very friendly, efficient and reliable team who take pride in what they do, and they do it well."
